### Widgetworx spritelab

SpriteLib is a collection of static and animated graphic objects (also commonly known as
sprites) that Ari Feldman created between 1992 and 2002 for his own game projects. Seeing
how it could benefit others, he decided  to offer it to hobbyist game developers to use
in their creations free of charge.

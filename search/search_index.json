Labels and equations are typeset with LaTeX, for high-quality PostScript output. Features of Asymptote: A programming language, as opposed to just a graphics program provides a portable standard for typesetting mathematical figures, just as TeX/LaTeX has become the standard for typesetting equations; generates high-quality PostScript, PDF, SVG, or 3D PRC vector graphics; embeds 3D vector PRC graphics within PDF files; inspired by MetaPost, with a much cleaner, powerful C++-like programming syntax and IEEE floating-point numerics; runs on all major platforms (UNIX, MacOS, Microsoft Windows); mathematically oriented (e.g. rotation of vectors by complex multiplication); LaTeX typesetting of labels (for document consistency); uses simplex method and deferred drawing to solve overall size constraint issues between fixed-sized objects (labels and arrowheads) and objects that should scale with figure size; fully generalizes MetaPost path construction algorithms to three dimensions; compiles commands into virtual machine code for speed without sacrificing portability; high-level graphics commands are implemented in the Asymptote language itself, allowing them to be easily tailored to specific applications. See an example: \u25a3 Blockdiag Blockdiag homepage Blockdiag generates beautiful diagram images from simple text format (similar to graphviz\u2019s DOT format). Supports many types of diagrams block diagram ( blockdiag ) sequence diagram ( seqdiag ) activity diagram ( actdiag ) logical network diagram ( nwdiag ) Layouts diagram elements automatically. Embeds to many documentations; Sphinx, Trac, Redmine and some wikis See a sample: \u25a3 Diagram.Codes Diagram.codes Diagram.Codes is a diagram generation tool. Describe your diagrams with a simple text language and automatically generate an image you can export. There are several class of diagrams to generate: Graphs and hierarchies, time diagrams, mind maps, process modelling, flow charts, state machines, onions layers, stacks, and accept suggestions on new types. For example, the Flowchart Diagram allows yo to write this: \"START\" IF \"is valid\" \"do this\" \"and that\" IF \"Is it good?\" \"Send email\" ELSE \"Save record\" END IF ELSE \"take another path\" \"return\" ENDIF And get this: \u25a3 Diagrams Homepage Examples Diagrams (Diagrams as code) lets you draw the cloud system architecture in Python code. It was born for prototyping a new system architecture without any design tools. You can also describe or visualize the existing system architecture as well. Diagram as Code allows you to tracking the architecture diagram changes on any version control system. Currently supports three major cloud providers: AWS, Azure, GCP. See an example: \u25a3 Ditaa Ditaa Home page ASCII art diagrams Ditaa (DIagrams Throught Ascii Art) is a small command-line utility written in Java, that can convert diagrams drawn using ascii art ('drawings' that contain characters that resemble lines like | / - ), into proper bitmap graphics.

This utility takes a plain text description of entities, their attributes and the relationships between entities and produces a visual diagram modeling the description. The visualization is produced by using Dot with GraphViz. There are limited options for specifying color and font information. Also, ERD can output graphs in a variety of formats, including but not limited to: pdf, svg, eps, png, jpg, plain text and dot. See an example: \u25a3 Graphviz Graphviz homepage Graphviz gallery Graphviz examples Graphviz Documentation Graphviz (Graph Visualization Software) is an open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. It has important applications in networking, bioinformatics, software engineering, database and web design, machine learning, and in visual interfaces for other technical domains. The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser. Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes. See an example: \u25a3 Lolviz https://github.com/parrt/lolviz A simple Python data-structure visualization tool for lists of lists, lists, dictionaries; primarily for use in Jupyter notebooks / presentations (But could be used in any place) A simple Python data-structure visualization tool that started out as a List Of Lists (lol) visualizer but now handles arbitrary object graphs, including function call stacks! lolviz tries to look out for and format nicely common data structures such as lists, dictionaries, linked lists, and binary trees. This package is primarily for use in teaching and presentations with Jupyter notebooks, but could also be used for debugging data structures. Useful for devoting machine learning data structures, such as decision trees, as well. See an example: \u25a3 Mermaid Mermaid home page Online editor mermaid.cli: Command-line interface for mermaid Mermaid is a tool to generate diagrams and flowcharts from text, in a similar manner as markdown, written in javascript. An editor is available for creating diagrams. With it you can quickly start writing mermaid diagrams. It is possible to: save the result as a svg get a link to a viewer of the diagram get a link to edit of the diagram to share a diagram so that someone else can tweak it and send a new link back See an example: \u25a3 PlantUML PlantUML Homepage PlantUML online generator Interview with the author Arnaud Roques Drawing UML with PlantULM Handbook PlantUML is the most well-known UML tool in this category with millions of UML rendered. We have covered it in-depth in this interview with his creator but, in short, it supports all important UML diagrams (class, use case, activity, sequence, component, deployment and object diagrams but, to me, the strong point of this tool is the variety of scenarios in which can be used. There\u2019s a huge ecosystem of tools around PlantUML to render textual UML diagrams anywhere you want. See an example: \u25a3 Shaape Shaape homepage Shaape is an ascii art to image converter designed to be used with asciidoc. The word Shaape itself is a neologism from shape and ascii art. Shaape is consistent between ascii source code and the produced image, What-You-See-Is-What-You-Generate Shaape supports a very natural form of ascii drawing (see the examples below) and attempts to keep the ascii source picture readable Shaape has an extensive feature set while maintaining a small and natural syntax From this text imput: *----------* * * | | | A<----------+ | | | | *----+-|---* | * | | * * |union* | | *-----+----* | | | v | | B | * * *----------* options: - \".*\": {frame:[[0, 0, 0, 0], 1]} - \"A\": {fill:[[1,1,1,1],[0.4, 0, 0, 1]]} - \"B\": {fill:[[0, 0, 0.4, 1],[1,1,1,1]]} - \"union\": {fill:[[0.7, 0.2, 0.2, 1], [0.2, 0.2, 0.7, 1], no-shadow]} You get this image: See a more elaborated example: \u25a3 Sketchviz Sketchviz homepage Sketchviz about page Sketchviz is a free service provided by Code 402, Inc .

It creates a visual illustration of the grammar used for programming languages. A specification file describes the syntax as a hierarchy of basic elements. This is processed into an image representing the same syntax with interconnected nodes. The specification is a set of nested Python function calls: indentstack(10, line(opt('-'), choice('0', line('1-9', loop(None, '0-9'))), opt('.', loop('0-9', None))), line(opt(choice('e', 'E'), choice(None, '+', '-'), loop('0-9', None))) ) This is processed by Syntrax to generate an SVG image: \u25a3 WaveDrom Wavedrom homepage Project source code in Github WaveDrom (Digital Timing Diagram everywhere) draws your Timing Diagram or Waveform from simple textual description. It comes with description language, rendering engine and the editor. WaveDrom editor works in the browser or can be installed on your system. Rendering engine can be embeded into any webpage. a quick example. Following code will create 1-bit signal named \"Alfa\" that changes its state over time. { signal: [{ name: \"Alfa\", wave: \"01.zx=ud.23.456789\" }] } Every character in the \"wave\" string represents a single time period.
